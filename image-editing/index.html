<p>
This project introduced two main design tasks in digital image editing: a book cover and a logo design.  
Through these assignments, I explored bitmap and vector-based techniques, and practiced creating visuals that communicate themes effectively.

        <p>
        This book cover design combines natural textures and a muted color palette to express the theme of harmony between the forest and music.  
        The visual elements highlight a calm and immersive narrative tone.

        <h2>Logo Design</h2>
        <h3>Creative Keys</h3>
        <img src="../assets/creative_keys_logo.png" alt="Creative Keys Logo" class="project-image">
        <p>
        The Creative Keys logo merges the outline of a piano key with a fluid graphic shape to convey creativity, clarity, and musical identity.  
        The design emphasizes simplicity and versatility for use in various digital contexts.
